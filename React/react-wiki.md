Indecision App

By these two scripts:     
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.0.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.0.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
You could creat your own small React app

Babel - a JavaScript compiler can be used to compile JSX to older version of javascript the browsers could understand.
Install it in the app so that I could write the JSX instead of tedious React.createElement() call

After install babel plugin in the app by command belowðŸ‘‡.
(base) Zhichengde-MacBook-Pro:indecision-app zhichengchen$ npm install -g babel-cli

Type the command belowðŸ‘‡ to all it automatically compile the JSX to corresponding file that browser could understand.
(base) Zhichengde-MacBook-Pro:indecision-app zhichengchen$ babel src/app.js --out-file=public/script/app.js --presets=env,react --watch

Connect to data dynamicly
Pull out the data from the variable to the JSX: 
- <p>{user.name}</p>
- {function(param)}
- {user.userAge ? user.userAge : 0}
- boolean && Ignore [if boolean is true, it returns Ignore, if boolean is false, it return false!!!]
{(user.age && user.age >= 17) && <p>{user.age}</p>} 
So, if user age is larger than 17, user.age is shows up; if user age is not exist or less than 18, age won't show.
